          <p>
          You've likely heard the saying, "The well does not go to the thirsty; the thirsty must reach the well." But we believe that everyone deserves equal access to resources, and it is our moral duty to ensure that every thirsty person gets their share of water. The children who go to school each morning with their backpacks are the future of our country. We must also remember those children who have set aside their backpacks to help support their families.

Our mission is to bring the greatest hope of the modern world to children who lack resources. We want to put books and pens in their hands and light the flame of curiosity in their minds. This light will help them see their goals and brighten their world. While we are not the first nor the last to make this effort, we believe our small contribution can make a difference.

To address the many challenges our country faces, we need a powerful toolâ€”education. This education should not just be about books but should spark questions and curiosity at every step, helping us understand ourselves and the world. If given at the right time, education has the power to help us overcome even the biggest challenges.

Our continuous effort is to reach every child who wants to learn and grow. Together, we are the hope for children who want books in their hands and the trust for those who dream of shaping their future. We need your love, support, and partnership in this mission, and we know you are with us. We have the ability to make this happen, and that is why we are Shikshastra.

          <i>&#x275D I have always felt that education holds great importance in every field, whether big or small, especially
            education that
            can be applied practically and isn't just theoretical. The foundation of education should always be laid in
            childhood.
            The level of energy and cognitive ability in children gradually diminishes with age. A significant portion
            of our
            population comes from backgrounds where their children are still unable to attend English medium schools. I
            have always
            believed that we should step forward and do something for these children. Over the past few years, I have
            organized
            regular classes in village anganwadis and have seen positive results. Now, I want to take this initiative
            further, which
            is why I have made efforts to bring education to children through digital means, using educational tools.
            The goal is to
            inspire children towards education and provide them with the necessary resources so that they can build a
            better future. &#x275E</i>

          <i>&#x275D The joy of learning a new language, understanding new subjects, and tackling new questions is
            indescribable. With the
            knowledge and understanding gained from education, we can eradicate all inequalities existing in the world.
            An educated
            and enlightened mind never wavers; it gives us the courage and patience to overcome and face every difficult
            situation.
            Education is a fundamental human right for everyone. Through our educational initiatives, we are making a
            small effort
            to open this path for more children, making life a little better and simpler for them.
